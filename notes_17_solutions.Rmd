## Main ideas

- Understand the CLT and how to use the result

- Perform statistical hypothesis tests using `base` R and `infer`
  
# Packages

```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(infer)
```

# Data

In the examples and practice sections, we'll work with a subset of data from 
the General Social Survey.

```{r read_data}
gss_2010 <- read_csv("data/gss_2010.csv")
```

# Notes

Recall the hypothesis testing framework:

1. Start with two hypotheses about the population: the null hypothesis and the 
   alternative hypothesis.

2. Choose a (representative) sample, collect data, and analyze the data.

3. Figure out how likely it is to see data like what we observed, **IF** the 
   null hypothesis were in fact true.

4. If our data would have been extremely unlikely if the null claim were true, 
   then we reject it and deem the alternative claim worthy of further study. 
   Otherwise, we cannot reject the null claim.
   
To do step 3, we'll need to compute probabilities from the t-distribution or
the normal distribution. Before we compute quantiles with `qt()` and 
`qnorm()`, to compute probabilities we'll use `pt()` and `pnorm()`.

Let's first see if we can understand how these functions work.

```{r base_viz, echo=FALSE}
ggbase <- ggplot() +
  xlim(-4, 4) +
  labs(y = "") +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r pnorm_1}
pnorm(q = 1.645)
```

```{r norm_viz_1, echo=FALSE}
ggbase +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, geom = "area", fill = "lightblue", 
                xlim = c(-4, 1.645)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, color = "grey60", size = 1.5) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = -3, y = 0.1, label = round(pnorm(q = 1.645), 3),
           size = 8 , color = "red")
```

```{r pnorm_2}
pnorm(q = 2.5)
```

```{r norm_viz_2, echo=FALSE}
ggbase +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, geom = "area", fill = "lightblue", 
                xlim = c(-4, 2.5)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, color = "grey60", size = 1.5) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = -3, y = 0.1, label = round(pnorm(q = 2.5), 3),
           size = 8 , color = "red")
```

```{r pnorm_3}
pnorm(q = -1.5)
```

```{r norm_viz_3, echo=FALSE}
ggbase +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, geom = "area", fill = "lightblue", 
                xlim = c(-4, -1.5)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, color = "grey60", size = 1.5) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = -3, y = 0.1, label = round(pnorm(q = -1.5), 3),
           size = 8 , color = "red")
```

What are these functions calculating?

These functions give us the probability of getting a value less than the value
of `q` that is passed into `pnorm()` or `pt()`.

### Example: hypothesis test for $\mu$

We'll work with the same data as last time.

The GSS asks "After an average work day, about how many 
hours do you have to relax or pursue activities that you enjoy?". A past
census study found that the mean hours was 3.6. Perform a hypothesis test to
see if this number has increased.

$$H_0: \mu = 3.6$$
$$H_A: \mu > 3.6$$
Let $\alpha = 0.05$.

First, we'll check out our sample data and compute some summary statistics.

```{r summary_stats_example}
hrs_relax_stats <- gss_2010 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(hrsrelax)) %>%
  summarise(x_bar = mean(hrsrelax), 
            s     = sd(hrsrelax), 
            n     = n())

hrs_relax_stats
```

#### Direct calculation via formula

Let's grab these three statistics as vectors.

```{r stats_vectors_example}
n <- hrs_relax_stats$n
x_bar <- hrs_relax_stats$x_bar
s <- hrs_relax_stats$s
mu_0 <- 3.6
```

Next, we need to compute our test statistic and the corresponding p-value.

```{r test_stat_mu_example}
test_stat <- (x_bar - mu_0) / (s / sqrt(n))
test_stat
```

The p-value is the probability of getting a test statistic value as extreme
or more extreme than `test_stat` given the null hypothesis is true.

```{r p_value_mu_viz, echo=FALSE}
ggbase +
  stat_function(fun = dt, args = list(df = n - 1), geom = "area", 
                fill = "lightblue", xlim = c(test_stat, 4)) +
  stat_function(fun = dt, args = list(df = n - 1), 
                color = "grey60", size = 1.5) +
  labs(caption = "The p-value is the blue shaded region.")
```


```{r p_value_mu_example}
p_value <- 1 - pt(q = test_stat, df = n - 1)
```

Why do we have `1 - pt(test_stat, df = n - 1)`?

How do we interpret this result?

Since p-value is greater than $\alpha = 0.05$, we fail to reject the null
hypothesis.

#### Infer

The `infer` package has a function to do these calculations in one
step. Function `t_test()` is a tidier version of the built-in R function
`t.test()`.

```{r infer_mu_example}
t_test(gss_2010, response = hrsrelax, mu = 3.6, alternative = "greater",
       conf_int = FALSE)
```

## Practice

Redo the above analysis, but perform the test to see if this number has changed.
Conduct your test at the $\alpha = 0.10$ significance level. Also, compute
a 90% confidence interval. What do you notice?

```{r test_mu_practice}
t_test(gss_2010, response = hrsrelax, mu = 3.6, alternative = "two-sided",
       conf_level = 0.90)
```

$$H_0: \mu = 3.6$$
$$H_A: \mu \ne 3.6$$
We fail to reject $H_0$.

For a two-sided test at level $\alpha$, this is equivalent to creating a
confidence interval at level $1 - \alpha$ and seeing if the inteval covers the
value of the parameter under the null hypothesis.


### Example: hypothesis test for $p$

The GSS asks "Are you better off today than you were four years ago?". 
Use a CLT-based approach to test if that proportion has decreased from its level
four years ago of 0.33.

First, we'll check the success-failure condition.

```{r success_failure_check}
gss_2010 %>% 
  count(better)
```

We're also assuming these observations are independent.

Use `infer` to do our test.

$$H_0: p = 0.33$$
$$H_A: p < 0.33$$

Let $\alpha = 0.01$.

```{r infer_p_example}
gss_2010 %>% 
  mutate(better = ifelse(better == 1, "better", "worse")) %>% 
  prop_test(response = better, success = "better", conf_int = FALSE, p = 0.33,
            alternative = "less", z = TRUE)
```

What is your conclusion?

We fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.01 significance level.

## Practice

Redo the above analysis using `base` R functions and `pnorm()`.

```{r test_p_practice}
p_hat <- gss_2010 %>% 
  count(better) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  filter(better == 1) %>% 
  pull(prop)

n <- nrow(gss_2010)

p_0 <- 0.33

z_stat <- (p_hat - p_0) / sqrt(p_0 * (1 - p_0) / n)
p_value <- pnorm(z_stat)

z_stat
p_value
```

These values match with what we obtained using `prop_test()`.

## Inference for other parameters

While we aren't able to cover inference for every parameter, you now have the
tools to conduct inference for other parameters such as the difference in
means, the difference in proportions, testing if variables are independent or
not, etc. Although the test statistics will differ, the general framework and
concepts remain the same.

In doing inference for parameters outside of what we covered, take a look at
the `infer` examples: 
https://infer.netlify.app/articles/observed_stat_examples.html. A
simulation-based approach is a good strategy if you don't
know the underlying theoretical distribution. Keep this in mind as you think
about research questions and explore data for your project.
